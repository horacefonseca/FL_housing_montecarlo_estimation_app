## Overview

This application applies Monte Carlo simulation to Florida housing affordability analysis, helping households make informed decisions about renting versus buying across different price points and regions.

### Key Questions Answered:
- **Can I afford to buy a home in Florida?**
- **Should I keep renting or buy?**
- **Which Florida region is most affordable for my income?**
- **What's my probability of default given my financial profile?**
- **How much equity can I expect to build over 10 years?**
- **What's the impact of hurricane insurance on my housing costs?**

---

## Features

### 1. Florida Household Data Generation
- Generate synthetic household profiles with realistic Florida characteristics
- Income distributions by employment sector (Tourism, Tech, Healthcare, etc.)
- Region-specific data (Miami, Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville, Panhandle, Southwest FL)
- **Synthetic Data Amplification**: Automatically create edge cases (high-risk and wealthy households)
- Credit scores, debt levels, savings, and financial risk scores

### 2. Monte Carlo Housing Simulations
- **Four housing scenarios:**
  - Keep Renting (with rent increases 3-10% annually)
  - Buy Starter Home ($200k-$300k)
  - Buy Standard Home ($300k-$500k)
  - Buy Premium Home ($500k+)

- **Florida-Specific Cost Modeling:**
  - Hurricane insurance (2-3x national average!)
  - Regional price variations (Miami 35% higher than Panhandle)
  - Property taxes (0.9% Florida average)
  - HOA fees and maintenance
  - Market volatility and appreciation

- **Dynamic Simulations:**
  - Income changes (promotions, job loss, raises)
  - Interest rate fluctuations
  - Property value changes
  - Unexpected expenses
  - Insurance premium increases

### 3. Comprehensive Financial Analysis
- **Affordability Analysis**: Probability of maintaining payments over time
- **Default Risk**: Probability of foreclosure/financial distress
- **Equity Building**: Expected home equity after X years
- **Cost Comparison**: Total costs across all scenarios
- **Income Stratification**: Outcomes by income bracket
- **Regional Analysis**: Affordability by Florida region
- **Risk Metrics**: Value at Risk (VaR) calculations

### 4. Interactive Web Application
- **4 operational modes:**
  1. Generate Household Data
  2. Run Simulations
  3. Analyze Results
  4. Single Household Analysis

- Professional Streamlit interface
- Real-time progress tracking
- Interactive visualizations
- CSV export capabilities

## Florida-Specific Factors

### Why Florida Is Different:

#### 1. Hurricane Insurance Crisis
- Insurance costs 2-3x higher than national average
- Annual increases of 10-20% common
- Major impact on affordability calculations

#### 2. Regional Price Variations
- Miami-Dade: 35% above state average
- Southwest FL: 20% above average
- Panhandle: 15% below average
- Different appreciation rates by region

#### 3. No State Income Tax
- More take-home pay affects affordability
- Attracts high earners from other states

#### 4. Seasonal Employment
- Tourism sector volatility
- Income fluctuations modeled

#### 5. Market Volatility
- Higher price swings than national average
- Migration trends affecting supply/demand

## Monte Carlo Methodology

### How It Works

1. **Probabilistic Input Variables:**
   - Income changes: Normal distribution (mean 2.5%, std 8%)
   - Property values: Normal distribution (varies by scenario)
   - Insurance increases: Triangular (5%-20% annually)
   - Interest rates: Normal distribution (adjusted by credit score)

2. **Simulation Process:**
   - Run 10,000+ simulations per household
   - Each simulation = one possible future (10+ years)
   - Month-by-month calculations
   - Track affordability, equity, defaults

3. **Output Metrics:**
   - Probability distributions (not single point estimates)
   - Percentiles (5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 95th)
   - Risk metrics (default probability, VaR)
   - Expected values with confidence intervals

### Key Distributions Used:

- **Beta Distribution**: Treatment efficacy (bounded 0-1)
- **Normal Distribution**: Income changes, property appreciation
- **Triangular Distribution**: Insurance increases, maintenance costs
- **Bernoulli Trials**: Default events

## Example Results

### Typical Output for $60k Income Household in Orlando:

```
Scenario: Buy Standard Home ($400k)
Time Horizon: 10 years

Affordability Rate: 68%
Default Risk: 12%
Expected Equity: $125,000 (median)
Total Cost Paid: $385,000 (median)

Monthly Cost Distribution:
  5th Percentile: $2,200/month
  Median: $2,750/month
  95th Percentile: $3,900/month

Recommendation: Moderate risk. Consider Buy Starter Home
for higher affordability (82%).
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Module not found
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Issue**: Tests failing
